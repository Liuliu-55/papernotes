# Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition

## summary

## Researh Objective

* Enhance nonlinear manifold during model
* Reduce the complexity of model

## Background/Problem Statement

* The latent concepts from input data are not always linearly separable
* The full connected layers for classification causes much parameters which would result overfitting

## Method

* Use MLP convolution layers instead of GLM convolution layers. Cascaded cross channel parametric poolong layers with mlpconv 
* 

## Evaluation

## Conclusion
